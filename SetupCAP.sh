# Source this script to define CAP environment variables used in the build and running of CAP6.0 with root.
# This script assumes the following environment variables are already defined
#
# The build and run CAP, you need to have the following tools
#
#   cmake    :  (cmake3) available (free) from: https://cmake.org/download/
#   make     :  indigenous to all LINUX, UNIX, and MacOS platforms
#   root     :  available from the CERN root distribution or from various sources
#   PYTHIA8  :  available from https://pythia.org
#   FASTJET  :  available from https://fastjet.fr
#
# To build and run the code, you will need a version root that works on your machine. Given root uses
# dynamic load libraries, it is sufficient (usually) to get a recent binary of root for your
# platform. Alternatively, you can also use a version built from the source. Note: EG libraries
# are no longer required with CAP.
#
# The cmake code assumes root is located at $ROOTSYS and
# that the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH, $SHLIB_PATH, $PYTHONPATH,
#
# To build the code after download
#    cd  CAP             : i.e., whereever you have located your download version of CAP
#    rm  -r -f build     : to start with a clean slate
#    source SetupCAP.sh  : source this file to configure the environment variables.
#    cd build            : swith to the build dir
#    cmake ../src        : to configure the build with cmake
#    make -j# install    : to build the code. # is a number corresponding to the number of
#                        : of CPU cores dedicated to the build -- more cores means a faster build
#
# To run the code after building, you need to have the following two environment variables defined in
# your shell profile/
#    HistosInputPath     : Desired location of input histogram files, calibration files, etc
#    HistosOutputPath    : Desired location of output histogram files, calibration files, etc
#
#    Example: In your .zshrc (MAC) or .zprofile scrit, insert
#             export HistosInputPath="/Volume/PathForHistosInputPath"
#             export HistosOutputPath="/Volume/PathForHistosOutputPath"
#    Note: It is preferable to define HistosInputPath and HistosOutputPath at the shell level
#          rather than in this script - since one should not have to edit this script to run CAP...
#
# See the src/Macros subdirectory for a list of instructions and commands to run high level
# analyses.
